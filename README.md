A 16 bit Shift register using VIVADO application hich transforms a 8 bits data into a serial data. For each rising
edge of clk, the output takes the value of one bit of the input vector E. The MSB of E is always send first and a shift is
done in order to send all E bits. This component has an input S_in which allow a serial connection between 2 shifter.
A synchronous input load, load the value of E inside the shifter
